Notable snippets from Dijkstra's EWDs:

 * EWD854: The Fruits of Misunderstanding ([html][ewd854], [pdf][ewd854p])

   > I think anthropomorphism is the worst of all. I have now seen programs
   > "trying to do things", "wanting to do things", "believing thing to be
   > true", "knowing things" etc. Don't be so naÃ¯ve as to believe that this
   > use of language is harmless.

   > Yet people talk about programming as if it were a production process and
   > measure "programmer productivity" in terms of "number of lines of code
   > produced". In so doing they book that number on the wrong side of the
   > ledger: we should always refer to "the number of lines of code spent".

 * EWD898: The threats to computing science ([html][ewd898], [pdf][ewd898p])

   > The Fathers of the field had been pretty confusing: John von Neumann
   > speculated about computers and the human brain in analogies sufficiently
   > wild to be worthy of a medieval thinker and Alan M. Turing thought about
   > criteria to settle the question of whether Machines Can Think, a question
   > of which we now know that it is about as relevant as the question of
   > whether Submarines Can Swim.
