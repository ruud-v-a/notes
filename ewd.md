Notable snippets from Dijkstra's EWDs:

 * [EWD854: The Fruits of Misunderstanding][ewd854]

   > I think anthropomorphism is the worst of all. I have now seen programs
   > "trying to do things", "wanting to do things", "believing thing to be
   > true", "knowing things" etc. Don't be so naÃ¯ve as to believe that this
   > use of language is harmless.

   > Yet people talk about programming as if it were a production process and
   > measure "programmer productivity" in terms of "number of lines of code
   > produced". In so doing they book that number on the wrong side of the
   > ledger: we should always refer to "the number of lines of code spent".
